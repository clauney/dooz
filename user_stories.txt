as a user, I want to create a new task
    - recurrence = none, daily/daypartly, etc.
    - 

as a user, I want to see my tasks
    - not completed, with completed tasks below
    - all relevant columns/fields/etc.
    - orderable?
    - filterable via text box

as a user, I want to clear my completed tasks
    - save them to some archive area

as a user, I want a quick way to set a task complete

as a user, I want some way to set the state of a task to in progress



Data model
    Recurrence
        Every Day (default: appears at midnight, late at 23:59)
            - post MVP: configurable start / late times with nice defaults
        Every Daypart (appears at start of daypart, late at end of daypart)
        Every Week on X day of week
        Every Months on x day of month
        None

    Dayparts
        ?MVP
            - system-built scheme of am/pm that all users have access to
            - Day broken up into hours, hours assignable to daypart. CONTIGUOUS!
            - placeholder for other dayparts, make functions generic
            ? placeholder for user-defined specific ones?
                
Functions
    Way to get next X days of tasks based on its recurrence
    Way to get all currently due tasks

QUESTIONS:
    1. Should this be dynamically generated each time, or should there be a store, with stuff added?
        almost certainly the former. trickier logic maybe but way less brittle. Try to avoid state!!
